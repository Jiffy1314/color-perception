# ðŸŽ¨ Color Perception ðŸŒˆ

Welcome to the **Color Perception** repository - a Swift package designed to analyze and manipulate colors based on human visual perception. This package is a powerful tool for developers working on projects where accurate color representation is crucial, such as iOS applications that focus on accessibility or visual aesthetics.

## Overview

The **Color Perception** package provides functionality for working with colors in various color spaces, with a particular focus on **CIELAB** and **RGB** color models. By leveraging human visual perception principles, developers can ensure that color contrasts, lightness, and overall color accuracy meet the requirements of their applications.

## Features

ðŸ”¹ Comprehensive support for CIELAB and RGB color models \
ðŸ”¹ Color analysis tools for evaluating contrast and lightness \
ðŸ”¹ Integration with SwiftUI and UIKit for seamless color manipulation \
ðŸ”¹ Easy-to-use Swift package that enhances color perception in iOS development

## Usage

With **Color Perception**, developers have access to a wide range of color manipulation and analysis tools. Whether you are adjusting color contrast for improved accessibility or fine-tuning color schemes for a visually appealing UI, this package has you covered.

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to analyze color contrast using the **Color Perception** package:

```swift
import ColorPerception

let color1 = Color(red: 255, green: 255, blue: 255)
let color2 = Color(red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0)

let contrastRatio = color1.contrastRatio(with: color2)
print("The contrast ratio between color1 and color2 is \(contrastRatio)")
```

## Contributions

Contributions to the **Color Perception** package are welcome! If you have ideas for improving color analysis or manipulation features, feel free to submit a pull request. Together, we can enhance color perception in iOS development and make applications more accessible and visually appealing.
